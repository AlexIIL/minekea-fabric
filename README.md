## Credits

Obviously this mod would not be possible if not for the people at Mojang making an awesome game. In addition, many
thanks go to the developers of the Fabric mod loader.

I originally got the idea for this mod after using the
[Shelf Storage datapack by Technodono](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/shelf-storage/). They have my sincere
thanks for creating such an awesome datapack and inspiring this mod!
